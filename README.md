Hi, I’m Michael Early – a Masters in Economics student passionate about data science, forecasting, and research. This page is a collection of my projects, ranging from university to personal projects.

Project list:  

****California's Fast Food Minimum Wage Hike and its Effects on Teen Employment****(Ongoing)  
  Type: Empirical Research + Regression Analysis (R/Python)  
  Focus: Labor Economics, Minimum Wage Policy, Teen Employment

-This paper evaluates the labor market impacts of California’s 2024 fast-food sector wage floor (AB 1228) on teen employment. Using CPS microdata merged with metro-border identifiers, it applies a difference-in-differences framework to compare teen employment trends in California to bordering states before and after the policy. The analysis highlights significant wage gains for fast-food workers with mixed short-run employment effects, while identifying a research gap in age-specific outcomes. Findings suggest that teenagers—who make up a disproportionate share of entry-level fast-food jobs—face unique labor supply and demand dynamics under sectoral wage standards

****NFL Super Bowl Probabilities: ARIMA vs LSTM Evidence from Betting Markets****
  Type: Time-Series Econometrics + Machine Learning (Python)
  Focus: Sports Economics, Market Efficiency, Forecasting

-This paper examines how efficiently NFL betting markets update beliefs about the Philadelphia Eagles’ Super Bowl win probability using weekly implied probabilities from futures odds between 2009 and 2025. Applying stationarity tests and an AIC-based model search, the analysis identifies an ARIMA(1,0,3) specification that captures short-run dependence driven by transitory shocks rather than persistent trends. To test for nonlinear dynamics, the paper compares ARIMA forecasts with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on rolling sequences of historical probabilities. Results show that while ARIMA reacts strongly to recent information and shocks, the LSTM captures smoother underlying expectations but cannot anticipate discrete events such as injuries or game outcomes. Overall, the findings support the view that betting markets incorporate information rapidly but imperfectly, with most week-to-week variation reflecting unpredictable, event-driven shocks rather than systematic forecastable structure

****NFL Sunday Ticket: Is It Profit Maximizing?****  
  Type: Theory only Economic Research Paper  
  Focus: Bundling, Monopolistic Pricing, Antitrust Policy  

-This paper examines the NFL’s bundling strategy for its Sunday Ticket package, arguing that the league maximizes profits by aggregating fan willingness to pay under a monopolistic model. It applies economic theory on bundling, price discrimination, and market structure to explain why team-specific plans are not offered, despite seeming more efficient.  


****Economic Growth in Developed and Developing Countries****  (Group Collaboration)  
  Type: Empirical Research + Code (Machine Learning)  
  Focus: GDP Growth Modeling, HDI Clustering, Feature Importance  

-This study uses World Bank macroeconomic indicators and HDI data to analyze the drivers of economic growth. It applies unsupervised learning (k-means) to classify countries and Random Forest regression to model and compare the impact of key features like investment, education, and inflation across development levels.

**Is There Wage Discrimination Among NFL Quarterbacks**  
  Type: Empirical Research + Regression Analysis (R)  
  Focus: Labor Economics, Race & Pay Equity, NFL Contracts  

-This study investigates whether racial discrimination exists in the second-contract guaranteed salaries of NFL quarterbacks. Using a sample of 37 QBs drafted from 2011–2020, the paper controls for performance (QBR), draft position, and team salary cap. Regression analysis in R shows no statistically significant difference in guaranteed money based on race. Performance and team spending capacity are the strongest predictors of salary outcomes.
