Hi, I‚Äôm Michael Early ‚Äì a Masters in Economics student passionate about data analysis, forecasting, and research. This  page is a collection of my projects, ranging from university to personal projects.

Project list:
** NFL Sunday Ticket: Is It Profit Maximizing?**
  Type: Economic Research Paper
  Focus: Bundling, Monopolistic Pricing, Antitrust Policy
This paper examines the NFL‚Äôs bundling strategy for its Sunday Ticket package, arguing that the league maximizes profits by aggregating fan willingness to pay under a monopolistic model. It applies economic theory on bundling, price discrimination, and market structure to explain why team-specific plans are not offered, despite seeming more efficient.

    üìÅ Code: N/A ‚Äì This project is theoretical and economics-focused with no accompanying codebase.


**Economic Growth in Developed and Developing Countries**
  Type: Empirical Research + Code (Machine Learning)
  Focus: GDP Growth Modeling, HDI Clustering, Feature Importance
This study uses World Bank macroeconomic indicators and HDI data to analyze the drivers of economic growth. It applies unsupervised learning (k-means) to classify countries and Random Forest regression to model and compare the impact of key features like investment, education, and inflation across development levels.
