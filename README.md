Hi, I’m Michael Early – a Masters in Economics student passionate about data analysis, forecasting, and research. This page is a collection of my projects, ranging from university to personal projects.

Project list:  

****California's Fast Food Minimum Wage Hike and its Effects on Teen Employment****(Ongoing)  
  Type: Empirical Research + Regression Analysis (R/Python)
  Focus: Labor Economics, Minimum Wage Policy, Teen Employment

-This paper evaluates the labor market impacts of California’s 2024 fast-food sector wage floor (AB 1228) on teen employment. Using CPS microdata merged with metro-border identifiers, it applies a difference-in-differences framework to compare teen employment trends in California to bordering states before and after the policy. The analysis highlights significant wage gains for fast-food workers with mixed short-run employment effects, while identifying a research gap in age-specific outcomes. Findings suggest that teenagers—who make up a disproportionate share of entry-level fast-food jobs—face unique labor supply and demand dynamics under sectoral wage standards

****NFL Sunday Ticket: Is It Profit Maximizing?****  
  Type: Theory only Economic Research Paper  
  Focus: Bundling, Monopolistic Pricing, Antitrust Policy  

-This paper examines the NFL’s bundling strategy for its Sunday Ticket package, arguing that the league maximizes profits by aggregating fan willingness to pay under a monopolistic model. It applies economic theory on bundling, price discrimination, and market structure to explain why team-specific plans are not offered, despite seeming more efficient.  


****Economic Growth in Developed and Developing Countries****  (Group Collaboration)  
  Type: Empirical Research + Code (Machine Learning)
  Focus: GDP Growth Modeling, HDI Clustering, Feature Importance  

-This study uses World Bank macroeconomic indicators and HDI data to analyze the drivers of economic growth. It applies unsupervised learning (k-means) to classify countries and Random Forest regression to model and compare the impact of key features like investment, education, and inflation across development levels.

**Is There Wage Discrimination Among NFL Quarterbacks**  
  Type: Empirical Research + Regression Analysis (R)  
  Focus: Labor Economics, Race & Pay Equity, NFL Contracts  

-This study investigates whether racial discrimination exists in the second-contract guaranteed salaries of NFL quarterbacks. Using a sample of 37 QBs drafted from 2011–2020, the paper controls for performance (QBR), draft position, and team salary cap. Regression analysis in R shows no statistically significant difference in guaranteed money based on race. Performance and team spending capacity are the strongest predictors of salary outcomes.
