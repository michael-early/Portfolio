Hi, I‚Äôm Michael Early ‚Äì a Masters in Economics student passionate about data analysis, forecasting, and research. This page is a collection of my projects, ranging from university to personal projects.

Project list:  
****NFL Sunday Ticket: Is It Profit Maximizing?****  
  Type: Theory only Economic Research Paper
  Focus: Bundling, Monopolistic Pricing, Antitrust Policy  

This paper examines the NFL‚Äôs bundling strategy for its Sunday Ticket package, arguing that the league maximizes profits by aggregating fan willingness to pay under a monopolistic model. It applies economic theory on bundling, price discrimination, and market structure to explain why team-specific plans are not offered, despite seeming more efficient.  


**Economic Growth in Developed and Developing Countries**  
  Type: Empirical Research + Code (Machine Learning)  
  Focus: GDP Growth Modeling, HDI Clustering, Feature Importance  

This study uses World Bank macroeconomic indicators and HDI data to analyze the drivers of economic growth. It applies unsupervised learning (k-means) to classify countries and Random Forest regression to model and compare the impact of key features like investment, education, and inflation across development levels.

**Racial Discrimination in NFL Quarterback Salaries**  
  Type: Empirical Research + Regression Analysis (R)  
  Focus: Labor Economics, Race & Pay Equity, NFL Contracts  

This study investigates whether racial discrimination exists in the second-contract guaranteed salaries of NFL quarterbacks. Using a sample of 37 QBs drafted from 2011‚Äì2020, the paper controls for performance (QBR), draft position, and team salary cap. Regression analysis in R shows no statistically significant difference in guaranteed money based on race. Performance and team spending capacity are the strongest predictors of salary outcomes.
