Project Portfolio

Hi, I’m Michael Early – a Masters in Economics student passionate about data analysis, forecasting, and research. This  page is a collection of my projects, ranging from university to personal projects.

Project list:
**NFL Pricing Model:** This is a soley theory-based paper that analyzes why the NFL uses a pure bundling strategy for its Sunday Ticket package despite media partners losing money. Using economic theory, it argues the model maximizes profits by extracting more consumer surplus from fans with varied willingness to pay—highlighting the league’s monopoly power and strategic pricing.
